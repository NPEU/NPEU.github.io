Filterability
=============
HTML lists - filterable

This is a bit of a departure for a Fall-Back repo. I may decide to move this elsewhere.

The point of this tool is to allow a list of ordinary HTML 'items' to be filterable without having to use a large framwork or library.

The HTML can be static or or come from a server. It doesn't matter. You just need to be able to include the script on the page and add the necessary attributes to your HMTL.

The idea is that users will get a static list if the JS fails, but it will become filterable if it doesn't.

Note that you don't have to use a semantic list (ul/ol) - it works with any list-like structure.

Advanced example
----------------

See [Codepen](https://codepen.io/akirk/pen/eGZLZr).

This example demonstrates the use of form inputs to control what elements provide the filter indexes, and the use of [Mark.js](https://markjs.io/) integration.
